# Black Friday Dataset and Feature Engineering
# Problem Statement 
A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

# :arrow_right: I have done the EDA & Feature Engineering part on the dataset. Model Training is an assignment for whoever is going through this notebook :smile:
